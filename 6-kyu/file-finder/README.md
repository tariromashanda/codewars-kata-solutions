<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/59de9e6a28fcedb892000142/train/javascript target="_blank">File Finder</a></h2><h3>6 kyu</h3><p>Sometimes some annoying students decide to mess around by creating horrible amalgamations of nested folders in shared directories. Sometimes they'll even stick a file in there as a sort of tedious file explorer "treasure hunt". In this kata, you'll have to search through a virtual filesystem of sorts to find a file, then return the path to the file. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-keyword">let</span> <span class="cm-def">files</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> {  <span class="cm-string cm-property">'New folder'</span>: {    <span class="cm-string cm-property">'New folder'</span>: {}  },  <span class="cm-string cm-property">'New folder (1)'</span>: {    <span class="cm-string cm-property">'New folder'</span>: {      <span class="cm-string cm-property">'funnyjoke.txt'</span>: <span class="cm-string">'lol i pranked you!!!'</span>    }  },  <span class="cm-string cm-property">'New folder (2)'</span>: {}};<span class="cm-variable">console</span>.<span class="cm-property">log</span>(<span class="cm-variable">search</span>(<span class="cm-variable">files</span>)); <span class="cm-comment">// New folder (1)/New folder/funnyjoke.txt</span></code></pre><p>Sometimes there might not be a file in the filesystem. In that case, just throw an error. You're always guaranteed to receive a filesystem with either one or zero files.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
