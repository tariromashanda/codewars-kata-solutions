This repository hosts my completed Codewars kata solutions.

The repository is organised using the structure: ranking (difficulty) / kata name.

Codewars uses a ranking system from 8-kyu to 1-kyu, where 8-kyu represents the easiest challenges and 1-kyu represents the most difficult.

Each kata folder contains a README.md file with the original challenge description from the Codewars website and the corresponding solution I submitted.
